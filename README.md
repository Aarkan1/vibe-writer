**Update (2024-05-28):** I've just merged in a major rewrite of WhisperWriter! We've migrated from using `tkinter` to using `PyQt5` for the UI, added a new settings window for configuration, a new continuous recording mode, support for a local API, and more! Please be patient as I work out any bugs that may have been introduced in the process. If you encounter any problems, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/savbell/whisper-writer/issues)!

WhisperWriter is a small speech-to-text app that uses [OpenAI's Whisper model](https://openai.com/research/whisper) to auto-transcribe recordings from a user's microphone to the active window.

Once started, the script runs in the background and waits for a keyboard shortcut to be pressed (`ctrl+shift+space` by default). When the shortcut is pressed, the app starts recording from your microphone. There are four recording modes to choose from:
- `continuous` (default): Recording will stop after a long enough pause in your speech. The app will transcribe the text and then start recording again. To stop listening, press the keyboard shortcut again.
- `voice_activity_detection`: Recording will stop after a long enough pause in your speech. Recording will not start until the keyboard shortcut is pressed again.
- `press_to_toggle` Recording will stop when the keyboard shortcut is pressed again. Recording will not start until the keyboard shortcut is pressed again.
- `hold_to_record` Recording will continue until the keyboard shortcut is released. Recording will not start until the keyboard shortcut is held down again.

You can change the keyboard shortcut (`activation_key`) and recording mode in the [Configuration Options](#configuration-options). While recording and transcribing, a small status window is displayed that shows the current stage of the process (but this can be turned off). Once the transcription is complete, the transcribed text will be automatically written to the active window.

The transcription can either be done locally through the [faster-whisper Python package](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper/) or through a request to [OpenAI's API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text). By default, the app will use a local model, but you can change this in the [Configuration Options](#configuration-options). If you choose to use the API, you will need to either provide your OpenAI API key or change the base URL endpoint.

**Fun fact:** Almost the entirety of the initial release of the project was pair-programmed with [ChatGPT-4](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4) and [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) using VS Code. Practically every line, including most of this README, was written by AI. After the initial prototype was finished, WhisperWriter was used to write a lot of the prompts as well!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you can run this app, you'll need to have the following software installed:

- Git: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Python `3.11`: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

If you want to run `faster-whisper` on your GPU, you'll also need to install the following NVIDIA libraries:

- [cuBLAS for CUDA 11](https://developer.nvidia.com/cublas)
- [cuDNN 8 for CUDA 11](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)

### Installation
To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

#### 1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/savbell/whisper-writer
cd whisper-writer
```

#### 2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```
python -m venv venv

# For Linux and macOS:
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 3. Install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Run the Python code:

```
python run.py
```

### Configuration Options

WhisperWriter uses a configuration file to customize its behaviour. To set up the configuration, open the Settings window:

</p>

#### Model Options
- `use_api`: Toggle to choose whether to use the OpenAI API or a local Whisper model for transcription. (Default: `false`)
- `common`: Options common to both API and local models.
  - `language`: The language code for the transcription in [ISO-639-1 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes). (Default: `null`)
  - `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the transcription output. Lower values make the output more focused and deterministic. (Default: `0.0`)
  - `initial_prompt`: A string used as an initial prompt to condition the transcription. More info: [OpenAI Prompting Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text/prompting). (Default: `null`)

- `api`: Configuration options for the OpenAI API. See the [OpenAI API documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/create?lang=python) for more information.
  - `model`: The model to use for transcription. Currently, only `whisper-1` is available. (Default: `whisper-1`)
  - `base_url`: The base URL for the API. Can be changed to use a local API endpoint, such as [LocalAI](https://localai.io/). (Default: `https://api.openai.com/v1`)
  - `api_key`: Your API key for the OpenAI API. Required for non-local API usage. (Default: `null`)

- `local`: Configuration options for the local Whisper model.
  - `model`: The model to use for transcription. The larger models provide better accuracy but are slower. See [available models and languages](https://github.com/openai/whisper?tab=readme-ov-file#available-models-and-languages). (Default: `base`)
  - `device`: The device to run the local Whisper model on. Use `cuda` for NVIDIA GPUs, `cpu` for CPU-only processing, or `auto` to let the system automatically choose the best available device. (Default: `auto`)
  - `compute_type`: The compute type to use for the local Whisper model. [More information on quantization here](https://opennmt.net/CTranslate2/quantization.html). (Default: `default`)
  - `condition_on_previous_text`: Set to `true` to use the previously transcribed text as a prompt for the next transcription request. (Default: `true`)
  - `vad_filter`: Set to `true` to use [a voice activity detection (VAD) filter](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad) to remove silence from the recording. (Default: `false`)

#### Recording Options
- `activation_key`: The keyboard shortcut to activate the recording and transcribing process. Separate keys with a `+`. (Default: `ctrl+shift+space`)
- `recording_mode`: The recording mode to use. Options include `continuous` (auto-restart recording after pause in speech until activation key is pressed again), `voice_activity_detection` (stop recording after pause in speech), `press_to_toggle` (stop recording when activation key is pressed again), `hold_to_record` (stop recording when activation key is released). (Default: `continuous`)
- `sound_device`: The numeric index of the sound device to use for recording. To find device numbers, run `python -m sounddevice`. (Default: `null`)
- `sample_rate`: The sample rate in Hz to use for recording. (Default: `16000`)
- `silence_duration`: The duration in milliseconds to wait for silence before stopping the recording. (Default: `900`)

#### Post-processing Options
- `writing_key_press_delay`: The delay in seconds between each key press when writing the transcribed text. (Default: `0.005`)
- `remove_trailing_period`: Set to `true` to remove the trailing period from the transcribed text. (Default: `false`)
- `add_trailing_space`: Set to `true` to add a space to the end of the transcribed text. (Default: `true`)
- `remove_capitalization`: Set to `true` to convert the transcribed text to lowercase. (Default: `false`)

#### Miscellaneous Options
- `print_to_terminal`: Set to `true` to print the script status and transcribed text to the terminal. (Default: `true`)
- `hide_status_window`: Set to `true` to hide the status window during operation. (Default: `false`)
- `noise_on_completion`: Set to `true` to play a noise after the transcription has been typed out. (Default: `false`)

If any of the configuration options are invalid or not provided, the program will use the default values.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! I created this project for my own personal use and didn't expect it to get much attention, so I haven't put much effort into testing or making it easy for others to contribute. If you have ideas or suggestions, feel free to [open a pull request](https://github.com/savbell/whisper-writer/pulls) or [create a new issue](https://github.com/savbell/whisper-writer/issues/new). I'll do my best to review and respond as time allows.
