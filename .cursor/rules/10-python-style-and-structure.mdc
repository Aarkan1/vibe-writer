### Python style guide

- **Simplicity first**: Write small, clear functions. Prefer pure functions and immutable locals.
- **File size**: Keep files focused; target <200 lines. If larger, split into modules.
- **Naming**: Use clear, consistent names. Keep functions short and single-purpose.
- **Types & docs**: Add type hints and concise docstrings where helpful.
- **Side effects**: Avoid module-level side effects; perform setup in functions/classes.
- **Comments**: Add helpful, explanatory comments. Do not delete old comments unless wrong/obsolete.
- **Logging/prints**: Prefer `ConfigManager.console_print(...)` for user-visible logs.

### Qt/UI safety

- Do not block the UI thread. Avoid `time.sleep` or long loops in UI code.
- Use signals/slots to communicate from workers to UI. Keep UI handlers minimal.
